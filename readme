# Sports Betting Application

This is a sports betting application built using Spring Boot and Hibernate. The application provides a RESTful API for users to place bets on sports events and manages the users' balances and bet results. 
Application is not 100% finished. 

## Overview

This application allows users to create an account, log in, and place bets on various sports events. When a match result is posted, the application will automatically update the balances of users who bet on the match.
The application is designed with a focus on modularity, scalability, and maintainability. It follows best practices for RESTful API design and uses Spring Boot and Hibernate to create a robust, extensible backend system.

## Features

- User registration and authentication through header.
- Role-based access control for different user roles (e.g., regular users, admins)
- Bets management (placing bets, retrieving bets, filtering bets by user or match)
- Matches management (creating matches, retrieving match information, updating match details)
- Automatic balance update after a match result is posted, with proper handling of winning and losing bets
- Data validation for incoming requests, with custom exception handling and error responses
- Unit and integration testing for key components of the application
